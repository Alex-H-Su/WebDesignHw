# Assignment 2

This is the repository for **Assignment 2**

Feel free to use this as an example to practice *markdown* 

1. Used '#'s and a *space* to creating a heading. Less is more
2. Use ** on each side of text to make it **bold**. just one * on each side makes it *italic*
3. I am making a list with numbers and a period. use a - for bulleted list. 

A space in between lines of text create **Paragraph

try to experiment with creating both [absolute urls]()
